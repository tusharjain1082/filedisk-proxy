# filedisk-proxy
i have created a file disk proxy example in Visual Studio 2019 C++. it might be of interest because we can use managed code like Visual C# .NET to build a Proxy Server Application for the backend Virtual Disk through the integration with the source code of kernel driver file disk. it's very simple to understand. the basic code to write virtual disk kernal drivers. the virtual disk is actually a file backend which is the vistual c++ user mode application, so we can also create dll and static library with the integration with managed code user application in C# and .NET 6.0 just recently released.

all code including kernel driver file disk modd included.
